# Backlog

Work that has been identified and deliberately not built yet. Nothing here is a
commitment to a date. An item earns a place on this list by having a stated
reason and, where one exists, the concrete incident that produced it.

Items are removed when they ship, not when they are attempted.

## Blocked on the owner

### DONE. The logo arrived and is integrated

Delivered with the approved v5 design as `logo.png` and `logo-dark.png`, now in
`brand-assets/` and served from `public/brand/`. `Wordmark.tsx` renders the real
lockup, `npm run brand-rasters` regenerates the icon set, the apple icon, the
favicon, and the OG card from the artwork, and the schema Organization logo
points at the mark rather than at the social card.

The icon is the reverse artwork cropped to the numerals on deep navy: the full
lockup at 16 pixels turns the descriptor into a smudge under the part that
matters.

Kept rather than deleted because two notes in it are still live. The artwork navy
is `#012758`, deeper than the UI navy `#14315D`, and the artwork is deliberately
not recoloured to match. And `scripts/brand-rasters.mjs` still restates palette
values that also live in `globals.css`, because the script runs in node and
cannot resolve the Tailwind theme; that duplication is now permanent rather than
time limited, so it is listed under Engineering below.

The original entry follows.

### The logo did not exist

Every mark on this site is a typographic placeholder: the header and footer
wordmark in `src/components/brand/Wordmark.tsx`, the favicon set, and the Open
Graph card. All of them are generated from `scripts/brand-rasters.mjs`.

**Why it is filed rather than worked around.** A commissioned logo is in
progress. Designing a second placeholder to replace the first one would cost the
same work twice.

**What to do when the artwork lands.** Replace the markup in `renderMark()` and
`ogHtml()` in `scripts/brand-rasters.mjs`, update `Wordmark.tsx`, and run
`npm run brand-rasters`. Everything downstream regenerates: `src/app/icon.png`,
`src/app/apple-icon.png`, `src/app/favicon.ico`, and `public/og/default.png`.

**Related.** `scripts/brand-rasters.mjs` restates three hex values and a font
stack that also live in `src/app/globals.css`, because the script runs in node
and cannot resolve the Tailwind theme. That duplication is deliberate and time
limited: the whole file is replaced when the real logo arrives.

### SAM.gov UEI and CAGE are withheld from the page

`/government` renders "withheld until confirmed against the active SAM.gov
record" in place of both identifiers. `samRegistration` in
`src/config/business.ts` holds `uei: null` and `cage: null`.

**Why they are not on the page.** A contracting officer checks a UEI against SAM
in about fifteen seconds. A wrong one reads as a firm that does not know its own
registration, which is worse than no identifier at all.

**Wanted.** Robert confirms both values against the live SAM record, they go into
`samRegistration`, and the page renders them with no other change.

**Also unverified.** `samRegistration.registered` is currently `true` on
instruction and has not been checked against SAM by this build. Setting it to
`false` removes the claim from the credentials strip, the capability statement,
and `/llms-full.txt` at once.

### No phone number is published anywhere

`business.phone` is `null` and the placeholder audit treats ANY ten digit number
in a phone shape as a finding, on every route, in page text, in `tel:` links, in
meta tags, and in JSON-LD.

**Why.** No number has been chosen. A published number is a commitment to answer
it, and a fabricated one on a government capability statement is the exact defect
`scripts/placeholder-audit.mjs` exists to catch.

**What ships when a number exists.** Set `business.phone`, add the digits as
`REAL_PHONE_DIGITS` in `scripts/placeholder-audit.mjs` so the audit enforces that
one number rather than forbidding all of them, and add `telephone` to the
Organization schema in `src/lib/schema.tsx`. `/contact` already carries a sentence
saying a number will appear sitewide when there is one.

### info@254engineering.com has to exist before launch

It is the only public address on the site and it is the point of contact printed
on the capability statement. A bounce there is a lost solicitation.

### The capability statement PDF is not written

`/government` says a one page statement in the format contracting officers file
will be published once registration is active and the SAM identifiers are
confirmed, and offers it by email in the meantime. Both of those are true today
and both stop being true the moment either dependency lands.

### Launch mode flip needs authorization

`LAUNCH_MODE=live` is built and audited in both directions by
`scripts/launch-audit.mjs`, which asserts 28 properties across the two modes.
Flipping it is Robert's decision and it requires the TBPELS firm number, which
goes in `TBPELS_FIRM_NUMBER`.

**One operational note.** Almost every page is statically prerendered, so the
gate is resolved at build time. Changing the variable requires a redeploy to take
effect. On Vercel that is already true of any environment variable change, so
nothing extra is needed, but it does mean the firm cannot be moved from pending
to open by restarting a process. See the note in `src/lib/launch.ts`.

## Engineering

### A failed database write is answered with success

`src/lib/intake.ts` returns a result rather than throwing, and both API routes
turn a failed write into a logged warning and a normal 200. On a database outage
the submission is lost and the person is told it was received.

**Why it is built that way.** The alternative loses the enquiry too, and loses
the person as well, because almost nobody types a message into a form twice. The
Resend notification is a second independent path to the same information, which
is exactly why the two are not chained.

**What would close it properly.** A durable queue, or a local write-ahead that
replays on recovery. Two best efforts is the honest description of what is there
now.

**How you would know it happened.** `[lead] write failed` and
`[apply] write failed` in the server logs, with the Supabase error message.

### The forms round trip is unverified on this machine

`scripts/forms-audit.mjs` runs 35 checks and skips 2: the ones that read the row
back out of `eng_leads` and `eng_applications`. They need
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, which was not available to this build.

**Why the skip is loud rather than silent.** A run that counted skips as passes
is how a broken write path ships. The summary reports them separately.

**Wanted.** Run `SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... npm run forms-audit`
once with real credentials. The audit seeds rows under the name `Zzq Formsaudit`
and deletes them at the end, so it is safe against the shared project.

### Resend has not sent anything

`src/lib/notify.ts` sends from `notifications@254engineering.com`, which requires
the domain to be verified in Resend. Until it is, every send returns
`{ sent: false }` with the reason and the row still lands. No email path on this
site has been exercised end to end.

### County pages are a later tier, and are asserted not to exist

`scripts/coverage-audit.mjs` probes `/coverage/harris`, `/coverage/travis-county`,
and `/counties/bexar` and fails if any of them answers 200.

**Why the assertion.** Adding a route is easy and remembering a content policy
three months later is not. 254 near-identical county pages is doorway content and
would cost more than it earns.

**What a real county tier would need.** Genuinely local material per county:
the authority having jurisdiction and its adopted code editions, the soil series
actually present, the design wind speed, and whether it is inside the windstorm
catastrophe area. That is research per county, not a template.

### The waitlist page is a route with a planned death

`/waitlist` carries `noIndex`, a `Disallow` in `robots.ts`, and is absent from the
sitemap, so the three signals agree. In live mode it still resolves and explains
what it became rather than 404ing links and bookmarks.

**Wanted eventually.** A decision on whether it becomes a permanent redirect to
`/contact` some months after launch, once the links have decayed.

## Content

### Region pages are the deepest content and the least reviewed

The wind, soil, and permitting sections on the eight region pages are the most
substantive claims on the site: catastrophe area county lists, soil formations by
name, specific regulatory bodies. They are written from general knowledge of
Texas construction and have not been reviewed by a licensed Texas engineer.

**Why it matters more here than elsewhere.** A wrong service description is
embarrassing. A wrong statement about which counties require a WPI-8 is the kind
of error a coastal builder would notice immediately.

**Wanted.** A review pass by the engineer of record before, or shortly after,
launch. The county lists in `src/content/regions.ts` are audited for completeness
but not for the regulatory claims made about them.

### There are no reviews, and no review schema

Deliberate. No `aggregateRating`, no `Review` nodes, and nothing on any page that
implies a rating exists. Revisit only when real reviews exist.

## Careers system

### The engineer application cannot be completed without storage

`scripts/lib/careers-audit.mjs` drives the technician flow through submit and
stops the engineer flow at the documents step. The engineer seat requires a
resume, uploading one needs Supabase storage, and a checkout without keys cannot
get past it.

**What is covered instead.** That the requirement blocks, which is the property
that matters, plus every upload API guard called directly.

**What to run once production keys exist.** `npm run forms-audit` with
`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set. Three checks turn from SKIP
to real: the engineer submit, and both round trips.

### DONE. Section 1 is no longer blocked

The `/brand-assets/` delivery arrived with the approved v5 design. Colour was not
extracted from the artwork in the end: the approved design specifies the palette
directly and `DESIGN_SPEC.md` records it, which is a better source than sampling
pixels. The original entry follows.

### Section 1 was blocked on the logo files

No `/brand-assets/` directory exists. Colour extraction, the header and footer
mark, the favicon set, the OG card, and the Organization `logo` property all wait
on it. Vector source is worth more than a raster: the header needs the lockup
crisp at 390 and the favicon needs the 254 mark cropped clean.

### JobPosting validThrough needs refreshing

Both positions carry `validThrough: 2026-11-30` in `data/positions.ts`. Nothing
renews it automatically, deliberately: an auto extending posting is one that
outlives the job. Refresh it or set `open: false` before it lapses.

## Insights corpus

### DONE. The four registry entries were flipped on deploy

Flipped from `planned` to `live` inside the merge commit that took
`feat/brand-and-careers` to main, which is where this entry said it had to
happen. Kept here rather than deleted because the reasoning is the reusable
part: a registry entry claiming a live URL must not be marked live until that
URL is actually live, or registry-audit fails on four correct 404s.

The original note follows.

### The four registry entries said `planned` until deploy

`data/keyword-registry.ts` carries all four insights posts as `status: "planned"`
with their real paths. They are written and they are on this branch. They are not
on the production domain, and `scripts/registry-audit.mjs` probes
`https://254engineering.com` for every `live` entry.

**Why it is not just set to live now.** Marking them live made the audit fail on
four correct 404s. The audit was right: the registry claims a page exists on the
live brand, and it does not yet. A `planned` entry may carry a path without being
probed, which is exactly the state these are in.

**What to do at deploy. CONFIRMED BY THE OPERATOR 2026-08-24: this happens in the
same commit that merges, not after it.** In that commit,
change `status: "planned"` to `status: "live"` on all four and delete the three
line comment above each one. Then run `npm run registry-audit` against the
deployed site and watch it verify four new URLs rather than assume it will.

**Also.** The same four entries were copied verbatim into both sibling repos with
a note in each `BACKLOG.md`. Those copies are uncommitted in the sibling working
trees on purpose: sealedengineering is on `main`, and one session per repo
directory is the standing rule. Whoever works those repos next commits them.

### A contextual link inside a SectionHeading lede does not count

`scripts/link-map.mjs` treats only `<p>`, `<li>`, and `<dd>` as prose containers.
`SectionHeading` renders its `lede` into a `<div>`, so a link placed there is
counted as template no matter how much prose surrounds it.

This was found the honest way: the linking pass added three links, link-map moved
by two, and the missing one was in a lede on `/government`. The link was moved
into the `PostureBlock` paragraph below it, where the sentence was already
reaching for it, and the count moved to 21.

**Not fixed, deliberately.** Wrapping a string lede in a `<p>` would make ledes
across the whole site countable and would inflate the contextual number without
anybody having written a new link. If that change is ever made, take a fresh
baseline first and say so, because the before and after numbers in this
workstream's report would stop being comparable.

### /insights/engineer-of-record-texas needs a cannibalization check after indexing

`/about` is live on `engineer in responsible charge texas` and the new post owns
`engineer of record texas`. Those are the closest two entries in the registry.
The intents differ, the post explains the concept and `/about` states the firm's
position, and the post links to `/about` rather than competing with it.

**Wanted.** Once both are indexed, check Search Console for the two pages trading
impressions on the same queries. If they are, the post keeps the term and
`/about` loses it, because `/about` has other work to do.

### /insights/texas-pe-license-lookup will not rank this year

KD 55 against a domain with effectively no authority, competing with PDH Pro and
EngineeringID. It was accepted as a tier 2 target with that stated in advance
rather than discovered in six months, and the reasoning is in
`docs/keyword-batch-phase-1.md`.

**Why it shipped anyway.** It is the highest volume term this brand can honestly
own, the page is genuinely more useful than what ranks, and it earns its place as
a link target for the other three posts regardless of where it ranks.

### Three candidate topics were researched and dropped

The windstorm program authority angle, on call contracting, and veteran owned
positioning all measured no search demand at all. Recorded in
`docs/keyword-batch-phase-1.md` with the evidence, so they are not re-proposed.
The windstorm material is still true and belongs inside the TWIA county pages
when the county tier is built.

## Visual layer

### The logo derived texture is not built, and is deferred to Section 1

Section 4 called for four things and three shipped: the diagram system, the 254
county map, and the icon set. The brand texture was deferred on the operator's
instruction because it is derived from the logo, and the logo does not exist yet.

**What it waits on.** The same `/brand-assets/` delivery that blocks Section 1.
A texture derived from a placeholder wordmark would be thrown away with the
placeholder.

### The map restates hex values that also live in globals.css

`src/components/map/TexasCountyMap.tsx` hardcodes five colours as hex strings
rather than reading the Tailwind theme. SVG presentation attributes such as
`stroke` and `fill` do not resolve Tailwind utility classes, and the per element
alternative, a class on every one of 254 paths, costs more than it saves.

This is the same duplication `scripts/brand-rasters.mjs` already carries and it
has the same expiry: when the logo lands and the palette is confirmed against it,
both files are revisited together. If the palette moves before then, these five
values move by hand.

**The values.** County fill, active fill, hairline, boundary, and the two opacity
figures on the boundary strokes.

### The county geometry is generated and can go stale

`src/content/county-geometry.ts` is written by `npm run build-county-map` from
us-atlas, which repackages public domain US Census TIGER boundaries. Part of it,
`REGION_BOUNDARY_PATH`, is derived from the region assignment in
`src/content/regions.ts`.

**The guard.** The generator stamps a fingerprint of the region and county pairs
into the output. `TexasCountyMap` recomputes it at module scope and throws if it
has changed. Every page carrying the map is statically prerendered, so a stale
file fails the build rather than drawing a wrong boundary forever.

**Injection verified.** A county was moved between regions, the build failed with
the fingerprint mismatch and the regenerate instruction, and the change was
reverted. The guard has been watched to fail.

**What to do when regions change.** Run `npm run build-county-map` and commit the
regenerated file in the same commit as the region change.

**Dependencies.** `us-atlas`, `topojson-client`, `d3-geo`, and the two matching
`@types` packages are devDependencies used only by that generator. They are not
in the runtime bundle. The generated file is committed so a deploy never needs
them.

### There are no service line icons, deliberately

`src/components/ui/icons.tsx` holds three marks: external link, seal, and
document. Nine service line glyphs were considered and none was built.

**Why.** An icon earns its place when it is faster to recognise than the word or
carries something the word cannot. "Roof Inspections and Certifications" has no
faster glyph. What a drawn roof beside it would do is move the page toward the
register of a consumer services brand, which is the register this site is
explicitly not in.

**If this is revisited**, the argument to beat is that one, not the absence of a
visual system. The diagram set and the map are the visual system.

### The mobile menu marks stay in CSS

`MobileNav` draws its bars and its close cross with positioned spans. They were
left alone rather than converted to icons: the CSS is fewer bytes, scales with
the type, and works. Replacing it would have been churn dressed as consistency.
